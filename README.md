# 31 Days of Cloud

Cloud professionals are expected to be familiar with several frameworks and tools that are used daily in cloud development. For the month of March, I am dedicating two hours everyday to learning something about cloud development. 

# Day One

On day one of **31 Days of Cloud** I set up a cloud account on AWS and learned the basics of Terraform. 

# What I did
**Cloud Account Setup & Terraform Basics**
1. I created a free tier account on aws.amazon.com
2. Downloaded and configured AWS CLI using the GUI installer
3. Installed Terraform using Homebrew 
4. Wrote my first Terraform script !!!! :D
5. but the script kept failing so I googled alot >:
6. Oops no S3 bucket but theres an EC2 instance running???
7. And then VICTORY! "terraform apply" finally worked! and I created a bucket :D
8. Documentation of my process and experiences
<br>**Bonus**: Learned some Markdown basics for the creation of this readme

# Documentation: The Process
As of 2022, the top three cloud providers Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), and Google (GCP) accounted for 66% of cloud services revenue worldwide, with Amazon's AWS as number one on that list.[1] With AWS being the more familiar cloud platform out of the top three, I decided to start my "learning about cloud development" there. I first created a new AWS account (https://aws.amazon.com)
